            <p>my name is mike esposito.  i have been making experimental electronic music for 20 years now.  you might even call it IDM.  currently i make it under the name blanket forts.  my current hardware setup is two nord modular synthesizers, an octatrack sampler, a tiny mixer and a bunch of cables.  i record everything live to audacity, except when i don't.  when i don't, the track is almost always a software project in logic pro 9, or a hyprid hardware/logic project.  i play live gigs with just the hardware; it just feels weird to me to pull a laptop on stage and there isn't much to do to be honest.  on the other hand, i use a laptop exclusively for djing because i can get access to my entire music library and it works out well.  my dj style has been self-defined as "manic illbient" since 2001.  when i dj i use capital letters and it's called DJ Blanketforts.  right now i dj for lumpen radio in chicago with a once-monthly show that i prep and send to them.  but enough chatter; go on and click on a link below!  oh, and math is definitely not music.  be forewarned.</p>
